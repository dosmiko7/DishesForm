# Dishes Form

A form that allows you to create orders for selected dishes and options assigned to them, such as the number of pieces, spiciness or pizza diameter.

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è Basic concept

The main idea behind the creation of Dishes Form was to learn about the possibilities provided by React Hook Form and MUI Components.

## üóπ Validation

Thanks to the combination of MUI Components and React Hook Form, DishesForm has client-side validation, which prevents submitting incorrect data.
